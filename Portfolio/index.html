      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><b>Hello,</b>
        <br>

        My name is Ojas Dhumal, and I am a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and software development. I have academics experience with languages like Java, Python, and C++, and I’m also well familiar with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to my technical skills, I have a deep interest in exploring areas like data structures, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. I am eager to apply my knowledge in a professional setting and grow further by working on real-world challenges.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although I am a fresher, I have worked on several personal projects and internships that have helped me improve my coding skills, teamwork, and adaptability. I am actively looking for an opportunity where I can contribute my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and take on exciting new challenges in the field of technology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me.</p>
